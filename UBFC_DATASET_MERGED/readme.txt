DATASET_2: For subjects 21 and 27: Facial images must not be included in any publication, presentation, or report.

The files ubfcrppg_data_processor.m and ubfcrppg_data_processor.py contains a simple MATLAB or Python scripts to read videos and ground truth data from the UBFC-RPPG dataset.

The ground truth extracted from the pulse oximeter is formatted as follows:

Dataset1: Ground truth is stored in gtdump.xmp files:
Column 1: Timestep (ms)
Column 2: Heart rate (HR)
Column 3: SpO2
Column 4: PPG signal

Dataset2: Ground truth is stored in ground_truth.txt files:
Line 1: PPG signal
Line 2: Heart rate (HR)
Line 3: Timestep (seconds, scientific notation)

Please note that heart rate values provided by the sensor were not used for evaluating our heart rate estimation method. Instead, our evaluation compared heart rate estimations derived from the remote PPG signal with estimations calculated from the contact PPG signal.
